# QRChat
Quick and secure temporary communication via QR code or link.

## Project Introduction
QRChat is an instant messaging tool based on WebRTC technology. It allows users to quickly establish a peer-to-peer connection by scanning a QR code or sharing a link, and engage in text-based chat. The chat content is not routed through a server, and is deleted after the session is closed, protecting user privacy.

The main features of QRChat include:

- Rapid Connection: Users can establish a connection by scanning a QR code or sharing a link, without the need for cumbersome registration and login processes.
- End-to-End Encryption: Chat content is transmitted through the encrypted WebRTC mechanism and does not pass through the server, ensuring communication security.
- Session Deletion: Chat content is automatically deleted after the session is closed, leaving no traces on the server.
- Cross-Platform: Supports web and mobile platforms, allowing users to communicate across different devices.
